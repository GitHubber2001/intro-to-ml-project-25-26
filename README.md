Assignment 3 project for the course Introduction to Machine Learning (for AI) [Semester 1b] 2025-2026.

# Project description
The task of our project is to create a model that can successfully identify whether the stellar object is a star, galaxy or quasar based on the provided features in the dataset. To do this, we will train a model on the stellar dataset from scratch and will evaluate its performance. The chosen dataset is the stellar classification dataset provided by SDS. It contains data of stars, galaxies and quasars.
